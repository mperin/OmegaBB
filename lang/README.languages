To make your own translation.

1. Make a copy of language.fr.php and language.fr.js and rename "fr" to your language.  ex: "language.es.js"
2. Fill out the two files, replacing "text here" with the translation.
3. Sign in as an administrator and change the language setting from the Admin page

Make sure there's no whitespace at the bottom of language.*.php
