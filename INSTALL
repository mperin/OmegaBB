Installation
------------

1. Put this directory into your web directory.

2. omegabb.sql is a dump of a MySQL database.  Create a database and import this file.
After import, the following tables should exist: file, log, post, session, thread, user.

3. At the start of config.php change the following lines to whatever your database configuration is

$settings->server='localhost';  
$settings->database='name of database';
$settings->user='database username';
$settings->pass='database password';

---

In the default installation, the account named "admin" has administrator status (status = 5).  
The password is "pass000".  Sign in as admin and click on the Settings button to change your password, 
and click on the Admin button to adjust the site configuration.

This installation comes with some example postings, to clean them out do the following
-delete the files in ./files (but leave the tmp directory and .htaccess)
-in the database, delete all entries in the tables "post", "thread" and "file"

You may delete the example user accounts, but do not delete "System".
